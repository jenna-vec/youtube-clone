a Front End React app that contains the following:

A text input for Youtube video IDs
A button that, when clicked, pulls that video id, and loads data from Youtube api
Function to embed the video on a page
Pulls video title + description programmatically from Youtube api and have it display alongside the embedded video
Bonus: Logs all video-ids and video titles in a log file local to the project
You will be tested on both design aesthetic and front end programming. No need to go too crazy, but try to make it look nice.

EXTRA: compile it and throw it on an AWS ec2 free tier instance
